Zeno Clash FOV powershell script

Put Fix-WeaponZenoFOV.ps1 in your steam game folder. Load a powershell window as admin (or enable remote scripts), and run it. If you don't know how, ask an AI/google. 

If not admin first run:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Run:
```
./Fix-WeaponZenoFOV.ps1
```

It'll ask what FOV you want for normal, and zoom. Or press enter to use the defaults of 100 FOV normal, and 90 for "zoom".
